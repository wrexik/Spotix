# Customization ðŸ”§:
Tool has options to custumize output text, color and font.

**All accesable in `spotix_config.ini`**

### Text ðŸ“ƒ:
- Font's are downloaded automaticaly on first run! but it's needed to have them because the tool checks for them everytime.
- To change font, download font in `.ttf` format and put it in the folder named `fonts` next set `font = 'YourFontName.ttf'` don't forget the `.ttf` and done.

- To change size easily edit `font_name_size = 97` and `font_artist_size = 80`.

That means `font_name_size` is name of the song
and `font_artist_size` is the name of the artist

### Color ðŸŽ¨:
- To disable / enable average color use `get_average_color = True/False`.
- To disable / enable dominant color use `get_dominant_color = True/False`
- To change color enable `set_background_color = True` and set `background_color = YourRGBValue` (don't forget it needs to be in tuple)

# To Do ðŸŽ›:
- [x] **Detect when nothing is playing**
- [x] Support for chinesse characters
- [x] Still background color
- [x] Dominant color maybe
- [x] Token refresh
