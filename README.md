![This is output](https://github.com/wrexik/Spotix/blob/main/output/output.jpeg)

# Instalation âš™:
1. First of all you need to create spotify application [here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)
  Log in and create application make sure you set Uri redirect to `http://localhost:8888/callback`
2. And now let's install requirements with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` and we are done here!
3. Now we'll edit the tool to work with spotify. Open `main.py` and edit these variables to match your spotify application
4. And now just enjoy.
```
myClientId='YourClientId'
mySecret='YourSecret'

font = "agrane.ttf" #or your font name
```
# Customization ðŸ”§:
Tool has options to custumize output text, color and font

### Text ðŸ“ƒ:
- Font's are downloaded automaticaly on first run! but it's needed to have them because the tool checks for them everytime.
- To change font, download font in `.ttf` format and put it in the folder named `assets` next set `font = 'YourFontName.ttf'` don't forget the `.ttf` and done.

- To change size easily edit `font_name_size = 74` and `font_artist_size = 70`.

That means `font_name_size` is name of the song
and `font_artist_size` is the name of the artist

### Color ðŸŽ¨:
- To disable average color use `getcolor = True/False`.
- To change color use `background_color = YourRGBValue` (don't forget it needs to be in tuple)

# To Do ðŸŽ›:
- [ ] **Detect when nothing is playing**
- [x] Support for chinesse characters
- [x] Still background color
- [ ] Fit text to image output
- [ ] Dominant color maybe
